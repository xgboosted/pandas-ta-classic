# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## **[Unreleased]**

### Fixed
* **Code of Conduct Contact Information**: Updated enforcement contact from original maintainer's email to GitHub Issues link, making it maintainer-agnostic and easier to manage as the project evolves.
* **PyPI Release Version**: Fixed CI/CD workflow to use exact release tag version by setting `SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION` environment variable. This prevents development versions (`.dev0`) from being published when `pyproject.toml` is modified during the build process. Releases now correctly use the clean tag version (e.g., `0.3.35` instead of `0.3.36.dev0`).
* **Version Scheme Optimization**: Changed from `post-release` to default version scheme to avoid `.post0` suffix on tagged releases. Tagged releases now get clean version numbers (e.g., `0.3.35`), while commits after tags get development versions (e.g., `0.3.36.dev1`). This provides clearer distinction between releases and development builds.
* **PyPI Image Display**: Updated README.md to use absolute GitHub URLs for images instead of relative paths, ensuring logo and example charts display correctly on PyPI package page.

### Added
* **UV Package Manager Support**: All documentation now includes installation instructions for both `uv` (recommended for faster installs) and traditional `pip`. This includes README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/installation.rst, docs/index.rst, index.md, and docs/indicators.rst.
* **Automatic Version Management**: Package version is now automatically determined from git tags using `setuptools-scm`, eliminating manual version updates. Development builds get `.dev` suffix (e.g., `0.3.36.dev1`), while tagged releases use the tag version exactly (e.g., `0.4.0`). See the Version Management section in CONTRIBUTING.md for comprehensive documentation.
* **Native Candlestick Patterns**: Added native implementations of `cdl_doji` and `cdl_inside` patterns that don't require TA-Lib installation. These can be accessed directly via `df.ta.cdl_doji()` and `df.ta.cdl_inside()`, or through the unified `df.ta.cdl_pattern()` interface. Native patterns join `cdl_z` and `ha` to provide 5 total TA-Lib-free candlestick indicators.

### Changed
* **Dynamic Category Discovery**: The `Category` dictionary in `_meta.py` is now built dynamically by scanning the filesystem structure. This eliminates manual maintenance, ensures it stays in sync with available indicators, and automatically discovered several previously undocumented indicators (`cdl_doji`, `cdl_inside`, `hwma`, `ma`, `drawdown`, `dm`, `vp`).
* **Updated Indicator Counts**: Corrected total indicator count from 143 to 141 indicators, and total count from 205 to 203 (141 indicators + 62 TA-Lib patterns) to reflect actual available indicators. Candle patterns now show: 5 native + 62 TA-Lib = 67 total.
* **Documentation Updates**: Updated README.md, docs/indicators.rst, and CONTRIBUTING.md to reflect dynamic discovery and correct indicator counts.
* **Python Version Support**: Updated to Python (the latest stable plus the prior 4 versions) following a rolling 5-version support policy. Version requirements are now dynamically managed via CI/CD workflows (`LATEST_PYTHON_VERSION` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
* **Development Status**: Changed from Beta to Production/Stable in `pyproject.toml` to reflect library maturity.

### Fixed
* **CI/CD Shallow Clone Issue**: Added `fetch-depth: 0` to all GitHub Actions checkout steps to ensure full git history is available for setuptools-scm. This prevents version detection failures in CI/CD pipelines.
* **Version Fallback Compatibility**: Changed fallback version from `0.0.0.dev0` to `0.0.0` in both `pyproject.toml` and `_meta.py` to prevent invalid version strings that violate PEP 440. The clean `0.0.0` fallback is compatible with all version schemes.

<br />

## **General**
* A __Strategy__ Class to help name and group your favorite indicators.
* If a **TA Lib** is already installed, Pandas TA will run TA Lib's version. (**BETA**)
* Some indicators have had their ```mamode``` _kwarg_ updated with more _moving average_ choices with the **Moving Average Utility** function ```ta.ma()```. For simplicity, all _choices_ are single source _moving averages_. This is primarily an internal utility used by indicators that have a ```mamode``` _kwarg_. This includes indicators: _accbands_, _amat_, _aobv_, _atr_, _bbands_, _bias_, _efi_, _hilo_, _kc_, _natr_, _qqe_, _rvi_, and _thermo_; the default ```mamode``` parameters have not changed. However, ```ta.ma()``` can be used by the user as well if needed. For more information: ```help(ta.ma)```
    * **Moving Average Choices**: dema, ema, fwma, hma, linreg, midpoint, pwma, rma, sinwma, sma, swma, t3, tema, trima, vidya, wma, zlma.
* An _experimental_ and independent __Watchlist__ Class located in the [Examples](https://github.com/xgboosted/pandas-ta-classic/tree/main/examples/watchlist.py) Directory that can be used in conjunction with the new __Strategy__ Class.
* _Linear Regression_ (**linear_regression**) is a new utility method for Simple Linear Regression using _Numpy_ or _Scikit Learn_'s implementation.
* Added utility/convience function, ```to_utc```, to convert the DataFrame index to UTC. See: ```help(ta.to_utc)``` **Now** as a Pandas TA DataFrame Property to easily convert the DataFrame index to UTC.

<br />

## **Breaking / Depreciated Indicators**
* _Trend Return_ (**trend_return**) has been removed and replaced with **tsignals**. When given a trend Series like ```close > sma(close, 50)``` it returns the Trend, Trade Entries and Trade Exits of that trend to make it compatible with [**vectorbt**](https://github.com/polakowo/vectorbt) by setting ```asbool=True``` to get boolean Trade Entries and Exits. See ```help(ta.tsignals)```

<br/>

## **New Indicators**
* _Arnaud Legoux Moving Average_ (**alma**) uses the curve of the Normal (Gauss) distribution to allow regulating the smoothness and high sensitivity of the indicator. See: ```help(ta.alma)```
* _Draw Down_ (**drawdown**) calculates the percentage decline from the peak equity of a trading account, or fund. See ```help(ta.drawdown)```
* _Candle Patterns_ (**cdl_pattern**) If TA Lib is installed, then all those Candle Patterns are available. See the list and examples above on how to call the patterns. See ```help(ta.cdl_pattern)```
* _Candle Z Score_ (**cdl_z**) normalizes OHLC Candles with a rolling Z Score. See ```help(ta.cdl_z)```
* _Correlation Trend Indicator_ (**cti**) is an oscillator created by John Ehler in 2020. See ```help(ta.cti)```
* _Cross Signals_ (**xsignals**) was created by Kevin Johnson. It is a wrapper of Trade Signals that returns Trends, Trades, Entries and Exits. Cross Signals are commonly used for **bbands**, **rsi**, **zscore** crossing some value either above or below two values at different times. See ```help(ta.xsignals)```
* _Directional Movement_ (**dm**) developed by J. Welles Wilder in 1978 attempts to determine which direction the price of an asset is moving. See ```help(ta.dm)```
* _Even Better Sinewave_ (**ebsw**) measures market cycles and uses a low pass filter to remove noise. See: ```help(ta.ebsw)```
* _Jurik Moving Average_ (**jma**) attempts to eliminate noise to see the "true" underlying activity.. See: ```help(ta.jma)```
* _Klinger Volume Oscillator_ (**kvo**) was developed by Stephen J. Klinger. It is designed to predict price reversals in a market by comparing volume to price.. See ```help(ta.kvo)```
* _Schaff Trend Cycle_ (**stc**) is an evolution of the popular MACD incorportating two cascaded stochastic calculations with additional smoothing. See ```help(ta.stc)```
* _Squeeze Pro_ (**squeeze_pro**) is an extended version of "TTM Squeeze" from John Carter. See ```help(ta.squeeze_pro)```
* _Tom DeMark's Sequential_ (**td_seq**) attempts to identify a price point where an uptrend or a downtrend exhausts itself and reverses. Currently exlcuded from ```df.ta.strategy()``` for performance reasons. See ```help(ta.td_seq)```
* _Think or Swim Standard Deviation All_ (**tos_stdevall**) indicator which
returns the standard deviation of data for the entire plot or for the interval
of the last bars defined by the length parameter. See ```help(ta.tos_stdevall)```
* _Vertical Horizontal Filter_ (**vhf**) was created by Adam White to identify trending and ranging markets.. See ```help(ta.vhf)```
